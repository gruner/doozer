# Doozer &ndash; A PHP Navigation Framework

This is an early PHP project I worked on. It is no longer in active development.

Doozer is a modest framework for generating the navigation and sitemap of small to medium sized websites.

You define the sitemap for a site as a PHP array and Doozer parses it into several different navigation elements, adding CSS hooks for styling the active state.
