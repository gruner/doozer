2009-04-03 Fixed a bug that when the first sub sub-item is an array, the generated link was "Array".

Functions that print something on the page have been renamed to start with 'print_' (i.e. 'print_navigation()', 'print_meta_tags()').

To keep using the older function names include the 'shortcuts.php' file which sets up aliases to the newer names.

To prevent duplicate id's from being generated, only the top level navigation items will be given an id. Sub nav items are given a class name to allow for any one-off styling needs.

In sitemap.php, you can define any level of nested sub-navigation (to accomodate sites like Berland). See the example in sitemap.php.

Also in sitemap.php, it is no longer necessary to add the '=> $no_sub' blank array to items that don't have sub-navigation. The item can just be listed on its own.
