## Bugs
* When first sub sub-item is an array, the generated link is "Array".

## General
* add back in the .head class for top-level li's that have a nested ul
* take out phpDoc comments because they add clutter, Dreamweaver chokes on them, and the generated documentation it too complex

## Allow for edge cases:
* multiple nav items that point to the same page
