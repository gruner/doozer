## Bugs
* When first sub sub-item is an array, the generated link is "Array".
* in print_inclusive_navigation() the .first class is added, but not .last unless it's the actual last item in sitemap.php
* sections links for breadcrumbs don't account for index_page options

## General
* take out phpDoc comments because they add clutter, Dreamweaver chokes on them, and the generated documentation is too complex

## Allow for edge cases:
* multiple nav items that point to the same page
