## Bugs
* sub_nav_p() doesn't format external links properly - it shows the url, not the name
* in print_inclusive_navigation() the .first class is added, but not .last unless it's the actual last item in sitemap.php
* sections links for breadcrumbs don't account for index_page options

## Allow for edge cases:
* multiple nav items that point to the same page
